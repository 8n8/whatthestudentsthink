A manual check of 20 random data points. 10 tests are done with the NSS spreadsheet, and 10 with the NSS3 spreadsheet.

# NSS spreadsheet

There are 5188 rows of data with sample size greater than 200, which is the cutoff, not all of which are used. Random numbers between 5 (the first row) and 5188 are generated one by one from random.org. If the row is not relevant then another number is used. 

For a relevant row, it is compared manually with the chart on the website and recorded below.

1) 431 OK
2) 68 OK
3) 2052 OK
4) 4116 OK
5) 1509 OK
6) 2319 OK
7) 4384 OK
8) 3963 OK
9) 2194 OK
10) 2363 OK

(Note that with this test, the numbers don't correspond with the rows in the spreadsheet downloaded from OFS, because I deleted a lot of rows that weren't relevant to make it easier.)

# NSS3 spreadsheet

A similar method is used as above, but there are 253754 rows of data this time.

1) 32622 OK
2) 121241 OK
3) 62998 OK
4) 49068 OK
5) 252149 OK
6) 132204 OK
7) 232357 OK
8) 136389 OK
9) 116560 OK
10) 1042 OK
