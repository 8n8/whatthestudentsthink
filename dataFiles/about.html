  <p>Simple charts of the 2019 National Student Survey</p>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>To make it really easy to browse the results of the National
  Student Survey, and so to help with choosing undergraduate
  university courses in the UK.</p>

  <h2>Reasons for missing universities or subjects</h2>
  <p>Quoting from the notes that come with the data:</p>
  <blockquote>
    "The results are only publishable if there are at least 10
    responses with a response rate of greater than or equal to
    50%."
  </blockquote>
  <p>and</p>
  <blockquote>
    "Please note that if no data is available for a particular
    course or provider where students were surveyed, the data did
    not meet publication thresholds. This does not reflect on the
    quality of the course or provider. It may be because the course
    is new or it is small, or we have not received enough survey
    responses."
  </blockquote>
  <p>In addition to this, I have excluded universities and courses
  that are very small.</p>
  <h2>First degree only</h2>
  <p>Only courses marked as "First degree" in the data are
  included. Other categories, such as "Other undergraduate", are
  excluded.</p>
  <h2>Part time courses are included</h2>
  <p>The charts include part time degree courses as well as full
  time ones.</p>
