# What The Students Think

A simple website for displaying the results of the National Student Survey.

# Program structure

The front end is written in Elm.  It retrieves data from the back end via JSON http requests.  The backend is written in Haskell.  There is no database.  It reads in the csv data files at startup and then holds all the data in memory.

# Building

Software versions that the installation is tested with:

+ Elm 0.18.0
+ Haskell Tool Stack 1.7.1
+ uglifyjs 3.3.21

The program has only been tested in Ubuntu Linux, version 16.04, both on the build machine and on the server.

You can build either a development or production version.  The dev version uses http on localhost:3000 and the production version uses https on port 443.  Edit the 'status' variable in haskellSrc/DevOrProduction to choose.

1. Build the back end with ```stack build```. 
2. Generate Data.elm (which contains integer codes for universities and subjects) by running ```stack exec generateCodes```.
3. Build the front end with ```elm-make --warn --output=main.js elmSrc/Main.elm``` .
4. Compress the Javascript file generated by Elm and put the result in the dataFiles directory with ```uglifyjs -o dataFiles/main.js main.js```.

# Install on server

There are three scripts for copying the data and binaries over to the server.  They contain the server name hardcoded, so will need to be edited for a different server address.  Make a directory on the server called ~/wtst, and then run (on the build machine) the scripts copyData.sh, copyRedirect.sh, and copyServer.sh.

# Start the website

## Https

The https uses a free certificate from LetsEncrypt, using the Electronic Frontier Foundation's certbot tool.  The certificates are installed in /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>.  The path to these certificates is hard coded in the Haskell file haskellSrc/DevOrProduction.hs.  The owner of the files fullchain.pem and privkey.pem in the certificates directory will need to be changed to the user name of the account that will run the program.

## Accessing ports

There are two servers, one that listens on port 80 and redirects everything to port 443, and the main server that listens on port 443.  Since a normal user is not usually allowed to use these ports, the program authbind is used to make exceptions.  Install authbind (available with apt or apt-get in Ubuntu), and allow access to the ports by creating two files in /etc/authbind/byport, called 80 and 443.  Change the owner of these files to the user who will run the servers, and set the permissions to be executable by the owner.

## Run the servers

Use screen for this, so that the servers will continue to run after the ssh session has ended.  From inside the ~/wtst directory, run the command ```screen``` then ```authbind ./redirect```, then type ```Control-A d``` to detach the session, run ```screen``` again, run ```authbind ./server```, then detach it with ```Control-A d```.  The ssh session can then be ended and the servers will continue to run.
